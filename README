ActsAsLookUp
============

A simple way to manage look up information for your application.  This is opiniated, the only values it can insert in a field are text, if you think you should be putting in numeric values, then don't use this plugin.

Example
=======

In the model, put:

class YourModel < ActiveRecord::Base

has_lookup :your_field

This will create the database entries for the look up field and create a custom validation so that only entries in the look_up_entries for the field can be
created.

In the view, put:

<%= f.select_from_lookup :your_field %>

You'll also need to create a nested route controller for managing the look ups, with a route like look_up_fields/4/look_up_items.  You can use the scriptaculous sortable structure to allow the operator to reorder each look up list.
