ActsAsLookUp
============

A simple way to manage look up information for your application.  This is opiniated, the only values it can insert are text, if you think you should be
putting in numeric values, then you shouldn't be using this app as the architecture (using a single table for all the lookup information) is not
suited to adding extra information to the table.


Example
=======

In the model, put:

has_lookup :the_field

In the view, put:

<%= f.select_from_lookup :the_field %>
